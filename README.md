## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0xarchit/fake-news-detector.git
   cd fake-news-detector
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your Gemini API key:
   ```
   VITE_GEMINIAPIURL=https://gemini.0xarchit.is-a.dev/analyse
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage

1. Visit the application in your browser
2. Choose between analyzing text or a URL
3. Enter the news content or URL you want to verify
4. Select the appropriate category for the news
5. Click "Verify News" to get the analysis results
6. Review the trust score, analysis, sources, and recommendations

## Backend Status

The backend service is hosted separately and can occasionally go offline for maintenance or resource conservation. You can check the current status of the backend API at:

[Backend Status Check](https://backend.0xarchit.is-a.dev/)

If the backend is offline, the application will display an appropriate error message when trying to verify news. Please try again later if this occurs.

## API Integration

The application uses the Gemini API for news verification. The API endpoint configuration is handled automatically based on the domain you're accessing the application from.

For developers who want to use the API directly:

```typescript
// API Request Format
const response = await fetch("https://gemini.0xarchit.is-a.dev/analyse", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: "Your news text or URL here",
    category: "politics", // One of: education, finance, politics, world, india, tech, entertainment, sports, science
  }),
});

const result = await response.json();
```

## PWA Features

This application is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that can be installed on your device:

- Works offline with cached assets
- Install prompt on supported browsers
- Full-screen mode when launched from home screen
